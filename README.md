About MeðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m at the very beginning of my IT journey, looking to have a future position like cybersecurity analyst or software developer. Iâ€™m currently teaching myself using Hack The Box and hands on programming projects. Right now, Iâ€™m working through beginner labs on HTB to build real-world problem-solving skills, while also learning to automate tasks and explore vulnerabilities using Python. My goal is to become confident in both cybersecurity and software development through consistent practice and self-guided learning.

I will be using LinkedIn and GitHub to share my projects, track progress, and hold myself accountable. If youâ€™re also learning, working in the field, or just curious feel free to connect. Iâ€™m always open to feedback, advice, and collaboration. 

Thank You for stopping by ðŸ’•
